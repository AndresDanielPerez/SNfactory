# SNfactory
SNfactory is a modular Python framework to compute particle emission from supernovae, their fluxes, and detection in experiments. It allows flexible implementation of SN models, production and absorption processes, luminosities, detection channels, and includes a module to simulate stochastic Galactic supernova histories.
